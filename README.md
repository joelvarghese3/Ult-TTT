Command Line Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game - (OOP JAVA) 

1. Each square of the 3x3 game board contains another, smaller, 3x3 game board. 
2. Where you make your move in a square of any small board, you send the opponent in the respective square of the big board. 
3. 3 in a row in a small board wins the small board and the big square. 
4. 3 small boards in a row wins the game. 
5. Strategize your play, plan your next move, let the opponent win some small boards, while you win the game!

7. The only difference my game makes is that you can't pick a new Board if the current Board is won. You are still forced to play in this Board even though that renders your move useless. You can only pick a new Board if the current Board is completely full. This new component adds a new and more unique type of strategy that isn't present in typical Ultimate Tic Tac Toe games.
