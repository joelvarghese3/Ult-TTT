# Ult-TTT
Command Line Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game - (OOP JAVA) 

Joel Varghese Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Project 

Hello, and welcome to my Ultimate Tic Tac Toe project. I have developed an object-oriented game of Ultimate TTT in Java with three separate game modes: Human vs Human, Human vs. AI, and AI vs AI. What is Ultimate Tic Tac Toe? Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is one large game of Tic Tac Toe played using nine “small” Tic Tac Toe games. For more information on the game, please visit https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/. The only difference between my version of the game vs. the version explained in the URL above is that players can’t choose a new board just because the current board is already won. In my version, you can only choose a new board if the current board is full. This extra layer of strategy forces opponents to think more tactically. For example, you can send your opponent to a board which is already won, essentially rendering their move on that board useless. With this added rule, games now require more strategy and last much longer. 

Features that my game has: 
-	Human vs. Human game mode 
-	Human vs. AI game mode (human can choose whether human or AI plays first move) 
-	AI v. AI game mode (instantly simulates game between two AI players) 
-	Prints the entire Ultimate Board after each move 
-	Prints which board the game is currently in after each move 
-	Prints the open boxes available in the current board after each move 
-	Prints the winner of each individual Board after they are won after each move 
-	Prints the current player as well as what box the current player chose (for both Human and AI) after each move 
-	Prints the results of the Ultimate Game if either player wins. Otherwise, if the Ultimate Game ends in draw a “tie” message is printed. 
-	Input validation so that human players cannot enter wrong numbers or characters
-	Input validation so that human and AI players cannot pick box or board numbers that are 
already full (forces them to keep picking until they choose a box or board that isn’t full) 
-	Human players have the ability to add their name to their player (their name will be printed every time they make a move or win a game) 

Features that my game doesn’t have: 
-	Smart AI that beats regular AI or Human every time 
-	no GUI since this is a fully Command Line Game
